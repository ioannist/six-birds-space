# TechRxiv QA Report

## Build

- **Build command:** `cd paper && latexmk -C && latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex`
- **Result:** SUCCESS — 32 pages, 784 KB PDF
- **Output:** `paper/main.pdf`
- **Undefined references:** 0
- **Missing citations:** 0
- **Multiply-defined labels:** 0
- **Overfull hboxes:** 6 (minor cosmetic, within tables; acceptable)

## Lean Build

- **Build command:** `cd lean && lake build`
- **Result:** SUCCESS — 1896 jobs completed
- **Warnings:** 1 minor style lint (`try 'simp' instead of 'simpa'` in QuotientMetric.lean)
- **Anchors verified:** PathMetric (triangle inequality), QuotientMetric (separation quotient), Pythagoras (orthogonality sanity)

## Changes Made (high-level)

### Cover Page Template (matching DE paper)
- Added `\usepackage{orcidlink}`
- Changed author from `\textsuperscript{1}` to `\orcidlink{0009-0009-7659-5964}`
- Added version/revision date line with Zenodo v1 DOI
- Emptied `\printaffiliation` (was full address)
- Reformatted footer: added email, short affiliation, "Preprint --- not peer reviewed."
- Fixed body order: `\maketitle` → `\thispagestyle{firstpage}` → `\printaffiliation`
- Removed `\vspace{1ex}` before keywords
- Updated keywords for CS/tech scope

### Declarations Section (new)
- Added full Declarations block: corresponding author, competing interests, funding, ethics, data availability, code availability, author contributions, AI/LLM disclosure

### Scope-Framing for TechRxiv (CS/tech positioning)
- Rewrote abstract opening: leads with computational pipeline and algorithmic deliverables
- Added "Computational contributions" paragraph to Introduction listing concrete CS deliverables
- Keywords updated to emphasize CS/tech: "emergent geometry; computational metric construction; closure audits; graph distances; reproducible pipelines; emergence calculus"

### Theory Disambiguation
- Added sentence in abstract: "Throughout, 'theory' is used in the SBT technical sense---a closure (lens + completion + audit)---not as a speculative hypothesis or manuscript-type category."

### Language/Tone
- "Closing" → "Conclusion" in Discussion section
- "checkable" → "auditable" in abstract
- "accounting law" → "cost law" in one instance (abstract) for clarity

### Rights/Licensing
- All 8 figures are generated by the repository code (no third-party material)
- CC-BY 4.0 confirmed in footer
- License recommendation provided in TechRxiv_Submission_Notes.md

## Remaining Human-Must-Fill Items

- **None.** All metadata fields are complete. ORCID is included. Affiliation is set.
- The Zenodo DOI in the footer (10.5281/zenodo.18494975) is the paper's concept DOI. If a separate v2 DOI is minted for this revision, the footer DOI should remain the concept DOI (which resolves to the latest version).
