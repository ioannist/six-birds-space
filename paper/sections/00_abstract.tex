Geometry is usually treated as a background container: points, distances, and curvature are assumed and then modeled.  From the Six Birds Theory (SBT) perspective, this conflates the object with the interface: we lack an auditable way to \emph{derive} space-like structure as a stable closure artifact of finite observers acting on micro-dynamics, or to distinguish genuine geometric signal from packaging artifacts.

We present an SBT-native construction in which \emph{points} are packaged macro-states (equivalence classes under a lens) and \emph{distance} is optimized accounting: costs derived from induced macro dynamics are composed into protocols and minimized over paths.  Operationally, we implement a reproducible pipeline (substrate $\rightarrow$ lens ladder $\rightarrow$ closed macro kernel $\rightarrow$ cost metric) together with coherence audits (idempotence defect, prototype stability, route mismatch, inter-scale distortion, and connectivity) and a curvature diagnostic based on loop holonomy.

Across controlled substrates, we obtain three checkable results: (i)~on an isotropic grid, the induced metric is connected and remains coherent across refinement (bounded closure and distortion audits), while constraints (anisotropic gating) induce a systematic deformation of the emergent metric; (ii)~under a fixed deterministic holonomy protocol, loop residue is near-zero on the plane-like grid (median $0.0479$) but shifts strongly upward on a sphere-like substrate (median $0.5980$), separating flat from curved regimes; (iii)~defining cost as negative log transition probability under staged isotropic diffusion yields an approximately quadratic, separable accounting law in which the median Pythagorean residual drops from $33.19$ at $\tau{=}4$ to $0.0586$ at $\tau{=}128$, while a Manhattan (L1) control produces diamond contours and does not exhibit this collapse.

These results provide a falsification-first, reproducible workflow for comparing emergent geometries (flat versus curved versus constrained versus fractal) without assuming coordinates, and for attaching each claim to audits and explicit controls.  We emphasize that stronger claims (e.g., continuum-limit convergence to manifolds or exact curvature tensors) are not established here; our conclusions rely on diagnostic proxies under controlled substrates with documented failure modes.  This work extends the SBT foundation~\cite{SixBirdsTheory} and complements our prior treatment of emergent mathematics~\cite{ToCountAStone}.
