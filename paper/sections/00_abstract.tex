\begin{abstract}We present a reproducible computational pipeline that derives metric structure from finite-state Markov dynamics without assuming coordinates: substrate $\rightarrow$ lens ladder $\rightarrow$ closed macro kernel $\rightarrow$ path-cost metric. The pipeline includes a suite of coherence audits (idempotence defect, prototype stability, route mismatch, inter-scale distortion, and connectivity) together with a curvature diagnostic based on loop holonomy, and all experiments are driven from committed configuration files with mechanized Lean anchors for the core metric constructions. Building on Six Birds Theory (SBT)~\cite{SixBirdsTheory}, we treat geometry not as a background container but as a closure artifact: \emph{points} are equivalence classes under a packaging map (lens) and \emph{distance} is the minimal cost of composed transitions (protocols) in the induced macro dynamics. Across controlled substrates, we obtain three auditable results: (i)~on an isotropic grid, the induced metric is connected and remains coherent across refinement (bounded closure and distortion audits), while constraints (anisotropic gating) induce a systematic deformation of the emergent metric; (ii)~under a fixed deterministic holonomy protocol, loop residue is near-zero on the plane-like grid (median $0.0479$) but shifts strongly upward on a sphere-like substrate (median $0.5980$), separating flat from curved regimes; (iii)~defining cost as negative log transition probability under staged isotropic diffusion yields an approximately quadratic, separable cost law in which the median Pythagorean residual drops from $33.19$ at $\tau{=}4$ to $0.0586$ at $\tau{=}128$, while a Manhattan (L1) control produces diamond contours and does not exhibit this collapse. These results provide a falsification-first, reproducible workflow for comparing emergent geometries (flat versus curved versus constrained versus fractal) without assuming coordinates, and for attaching each claim to audits and explicit controls. Throughout, ``theory'' is used in the SBT technical sense---a closure (lens + completion + audit)---not as a speculative hypothesis or manuscript-type category. We emphasize that stronger claims (e.g., continuum-limit convergence to manifolds or exact curvature tensors) are not established here; our conclusions rely on diagnostic proxies under controlled substrates with documented failure modes. This work extends the SBT foundation~\cite{SixBirdsTheory} and complements our prior treatment of emergent mathematics~\cite{ToCountAStone}.\end{abstract}
